        <c:documentation>
            The sides of a child panel, the source, 
            that can be aligned with 
            a target side of a parent panel.
            
            The alignment side must be 
            orthogonal to the side of 
            the <c:link to="pvc.options.varia.PanelPosition" />.
            
            By combining the alignment source
            with the <c:link to="pvc.options.varia.PanelAlignmentTarget"/>,
            different alignment combinations can be achieved.
            
            The alignment target side must be 
            parallel to the side of source alignment.

    <c:atomType name="PanelAlignmentTarget" space="pvc.options.varia" base="string">
        <c:documentation>
            The sides of a parent panel, the target, 
            with which the alignment side of a source child panel 
            can be aligned to.
            
            The alignment target side must be 
            parallel to the side of source alignment.
            
            Wherever an alignment target argument is found,
            a value of type <tt>number</tt>,
            a numeric <tt>string</tt> or 
            a numeric percentage <tt>string</tt>, 
            may also be specified.
            
            In this case, 
            these specify the position of alignment, 
            from the left or top sides,
            whichever is parallel to the alignment source side.
            
            For example, if the source alignment side is <tt>'right'</tt>
            and the target alignment specifies <tt>'10%'</tt>,
            then the right side of the child panel would be
            placed at a position of 
            10% of the parent panel's client width
            from the parent's left side.

                The source side of the child panel
                is placed at the same position as the
                vertical center position of the 
                <i>page</i> height of the parent panel.
                
                The page height differs from the chart height
                in that the 
                page height is by definition 
                the value initially specified in 
                <c:link to="pvc.options.charts.BasicChart#height" />,
                and the chart height 
                can grow if layout so requires it,
                like it does in <i>small multiples</i> charts.
                
                The page middle alignment allows, 
                for example, 
                placing the legend panel in 
                the middle of the screen height,
                even though the height of the chart
                may have become much larger.
